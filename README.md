Lab for front-end techs.

The form form_reset.php is used just as a demonstration concept.
It is intended to let the user enter a few choices, send by GET
the user inputs to the same form and print them.

Further, there must be a "Reset" button, to ease the user to enter new choices.

An input type="reset" is useless since it only resets the input tags to their initial values.
We must clear the values and then print the form again.

I've tried different options but none seems to work.
Any ideas?
